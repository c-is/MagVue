Contact: hello@jigen.design

Former UI/UX/Web/Interactive Design company owner. Always a designer. As a studio we were working on the newest UI/UX/3D design technologies, developing a fresh and brave creations for companies and individuals.

From 2017 on: Over recent years, I've been active within Industrial design and CGI/VFX areas but am primarily focused on the second. I have always felt a tremendous ambition towards three-dimensional creations henceI decided to go this way professionally. Currently: 3D modeling, rigging&animation, visual effects and simulations.

Until 2017: 2D + 3D creations, DTP, visual identities, UI/UX/3D. Former studio owner and CEO/Designer. We were working on the newest design technologies, developing a fresh and brave creations for companies and individuals.

Then and now, as a chief executive and designer, my goal has been to ascend my clients' entrepreneurial experiences and uplift them from the grey mass of a copy-paste neutrality. I am truly focused on social awareness and have been consciously approaching problems without having to push or idealise my products just for sake of public relations and so called status. The creative industry is full of non-existing solutions that were advertised as "developed" just to showcase someone's abilities and fuel their delusional ego. I value honesty - sometimes it‚Äôs being perceived as a harsh endeavour, but I definitely propone this way. Also, I have got a decent analytical skills, therefore I might help you think.

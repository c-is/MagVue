In optics, dispersion of light is created by variable lens' refractive indexes - it was a main topic for these series of animations and imagery. Inspired by chromatic aberration, I've designed a simple _no-gravity_ metaball to correlate with its surroundings. My focus has been to study low values of colours' wavelenght dispersion within a dielectric material in relation to emissive backgrounds or organic patterns.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Keyshot Render</small>

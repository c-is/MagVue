This is beginning of a big personal project with visual effects and simulation studies. Each element of nature will be showcased in groups of three or more natural simulations based on real-life physics; in example: Flames, Smoke, Lava and Explosion shots will define the Group of Fire. These renders are a result of first two simulations, henceforth please stay tuned for updates and a new showreel with all of them presented together in a short film.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Houdini Indie, Arnold Render</small>

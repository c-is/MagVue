This is another take on my _triple-abbe-dispersion technique_. The serie of experiments drove me to deliver an animation and renders presenting the results of my visual research on optics in dielectric glass environment. From applying the lowest value of dispersed glass on a lens, an additional screen,

the collider and inner mesh I have resulted in abstract imagery with multi-coloured areas. The further monochromatically graphic pictures are rendered with intersecting geometry ignorance setting. It is an interesting result which was quite surprising for an outcome of highly dispersed shaders.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Houdini Indie, Keyshot Render</small>

My plan for this project was to simulate liquid dynamics within an organically moving collider. The usual problem that occurs when setting physical values is particles not recognising walls of an object they are supposed to rebound from.

This issue intensifies when a mother body is morphing rapidly, therefore it is crucial to find a balance between margin settings and the size of a particle.<br><br>This project is a result of metallic and dielectric material study over colliding liquid simulation. Additionally, I have created a node-based shader that resembles a lava with its heat-emitting fractal displacements. Other effects, for example a double refracted iridescence (so-called holo) are achieved by placing the same material with a dissolve map and specular fresnels upon the collider and the inner mass. <br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Houdini Indie, Keyshot Render</small>

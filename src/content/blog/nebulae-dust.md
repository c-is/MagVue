This volumetric cosmic gas effect is created with attractors and forces within a Houdini particle system. To achieve an organic nuclear mass I have generated dust particles,

triggered them with physical values and imported into Arnold afterwards. Having created the emitting node-shader I could design a colour scheme commonly appearing within nebulae. The final step was to rig a camera and render a sequence from inside the body.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Houdini Indie, Cinema 4D, Arnold Render</small>

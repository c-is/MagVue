_Sliding cat_ is a rigging and animation project featuring a cartoony feline character. The cat _apparently_ has got major problems with its bony labyrinth which occurs in lacking sense of body balance. ðŸ¤• I started from creating the model with a hyper-nurb modeling technique. Secondly, I added weights to body parts and bound the rigging skeleton to particular objects.

In the end of the process I have animated the rig to achieve a slippery walk cycle. <br><br>Hand's rig has been programmed in Xpresso nodes + simple Python equations that resulted in automated fingers' controls, delivering more efficient process when morhping expressions, keyframing and baking final sequences. Further animation is custom and is a product of syncing multiple procedural body morphs.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Xpresso, Keyshot Render</small>

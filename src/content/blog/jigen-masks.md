Jigen brand's mascots inspired by Constantin Brancusi's scuptures. The primary purpose was to create disturbing masks to utilise in simulations as an experimental body, and to study oxidised surfaces with curvature shading. Recently retopologised, the models are rigging and animation friendly. Soon to be featured in a new RDB & Destruction project in Houdini Indie.<br><br><small><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Keyshot Render</small>

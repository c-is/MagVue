Upon getting an enquiry to deliver a ridiculous crotch animation for an independent psy-techno video, I had decided to reuse it later in a personal project that matches the aesthetics of Jigen brand's own motive. Therefore, I have utilised this model to create a short video synced with typography design. Having called out the patriarchal order which rapes women's&femme's rights, this straighforward animation sarcastically places a Viewer under the object - it shall be confusing, especially when the liquid is splashing onto a screen, performing a golden urine shower. A degrading micturate of _temporarily_ privileged global system.<small><br><br><b>Software:</b><br>Cinema 4D, Realflow/Houdini Indie, Keyshot Render</small>

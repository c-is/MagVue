My brother knows Karl Marx
He met him eating mushrooms in the people's park
He said, "What do you think about my manifesto?"
"I like your manifesto, put it to the test-o"
Took it straight down to meet the anarchist party
I met a groovy guy, he was arty-farty
He said, "I know a little Latin: anicus anicae"
Said, "I don't know what it means," he said, "Neither do I"
Eat natural foods, bathe twice daily
Fill your nostrils up with gravy
Don't drink tea and don't drink coffee
Cover your chin in Yorkshire toffee.
